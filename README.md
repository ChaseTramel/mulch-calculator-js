# Mulch Calculator in Vanilla JavaScript

This is a learning project that I developed as an interation on [Mulch Calculator WP Widget](https://github.com/ChaseTramel/mulch-Calculator-WP-Widget). It creates a simple page that allows for user to input the size of the area that needs to be covered in mulch, and outputs how many bags of mulch they need.
