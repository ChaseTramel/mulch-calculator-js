# Mulch Calculator in Vanilla JavaScript

This is a learning project that I developed as an interation on [Mulch Calculator WP Widget](https://github.com/ChaseTramel/mulch-Calculator-WP-Widget). It creates a simple page that allows for user to input the size of the area that needs to be covered in mulch, and outputs data about how many bags of mulch they need and how much that might cost.

Added functionality to optionally change bag size and price.
